# Changelog

## [2.4.2] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **macOS Port Detection (Issue #21)**: Fixed `parseListeningPorts` incorrectly including ports from other processes. Now filters `lsof` output by PID to ensure only the target Language Server's ports are detected.

### Added
- **Enhanced Diagnostics**: Auto-reported issues now include additional debugging information:
  - Token Preview (first 8 characters of CSRF token)
  - Port Sources (command line vs netstat)
  - Protocol Used (HTTPS or HTTP fallback)
  - Retry Count

## [2.4.1] - 2025-12-27
### Added
- **Auto-Accept Interval Configuration**: Added `tfa.system.autoAcceptInterval` setting to customize the polling frequency of the Auto-Accept feature (default: 800ms).
- **Full Localization Support**: Added professional translations for all 13 supported languages for the Auto-Accept feature, commands, and tooltips.
- **UI Label Strategy**: Standardized all panel labels and command titles to remain in English for technical consistency, while localized tooltips now provide detailed descriptions.

## [2.4.0] - 2025-12-27

### Changed
- **Tooltip System Refactor**: Completely rewritten tooltip system using a global manager. Tooltips now use `position: fixed` relative to the viewport, ensuring full-width display without clipping or overflow issues in narrow sidebars.
- **Footer UI Update**: Updated "Feedback" and "Star" buttons in the sidebar footer to use VS Code's native secondary button styling for a more consistent and professional look.

### Fixed
- **Tooltip Positioning**: Resolved issues where tooltips would be cut off by the panel boundaries or overlap incorrectly with other elements.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- **User Info Extraction**: Now extracts user subscription information from Antigravity API (tier, plan name, upgrade options).
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Added support for tracking Prompt Credits and Flow Credits usage with formatted display.

## [2.2.2] - 2025-12-20

### Changed
- **Cache Settings Reorganization**: Moved cache-related settings (`autoClean`, `autoCleanKeepCount`, `scanInterval`, `warningSize`, `hideEmptyFolders`) from "System & Maintenance" to a dedicated "TFA: Cache" configuration group for better discoverability.
- **Configuration Namespace Update**: Renamed cache settings from `tfa.system.*` to `tfa.cache.*` namespace for clearer semantics.

## [2.2.1] - 2025-12-18

### Changed
- **Configuration Adjustment**: Global update from `gagp` to `tfa` (Toolkit for Antigravity) and reorganized all settings into logical groups (Dashboard, Status Bar, System).

### Added
- **Service Recovery UI**: Added dedicated "Restart Service" and "Reset Status" buttons in the sidebar for quick troubleshooting of Agent unresponsiveness and quota sync issues.

### Fixed
- **Status Bar Display**: Fixed `resetTime` not updating and `used`/`remaining` formats always showing as percentage. They now correctly display time (e.g., "2h 30m") and fractional values (e.g., "25/100") [Fixes #9].
- **Localization Loading**: Fixed an issue where localized strings (`report.*`) were missing in automated bug reports due to a packaging error in v2.2.0 [Fixes #5, #8].
- **Test Coverage**: Added automated tests to ensure localization integrity and status bar format correctness.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- **Intelligent Feedback System**: Added a localization-aware bug reporting system with automatic diagnostic pre-filling (version, OS, error codes).
