# Changelog

## [2.2.1] - 2025-12-18

### Changed
- **Configuration Adjustment**: Global update from `gagp` to `tfa` (Toolkit for Antigravity) and reorganized all settings into logical groups (Dashboard, Status Bar, System).
- **Gauge Spacing**: Refined visual spacing between individual gauges and labels for a more compact and balanced layout.

### Added
- **Service Recovery UI**: Added dedicated "Restart Service" and "Reset Status" buttons in the sidebar for quick troubleshooting of Agent unresponsiveness and quota sync issues.

### Fixed
- **Status Bar Display**: Fixed `resetTime` not updating and `used`/`remaining` formats always showing as percentage. They now correctly display time (e.g., "2h 30m") and fractional values (e.g., "25/100") [Fixes #9].
- **Localization Loading**: Fixed an issue where localized strings (`report.*`) were missing in automated bug reports due to a packaging error in v2.2.0 [Fixes #5, #8].
- **Test Coverage**: Added automated tests to ensure localization integrity and status bar format correctness.

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-18

### Added
- **Modular Gauge Architecture**: Refactored the quota visualization system into a strategy-based modular architecture, allowing for multiple display styles.
- **Precision Semi-Arc Gauge**: Implemented a new 210-degree "Industrial Precision" instrument style with multi-track layout and theme-adaptive coloring (set as default).
- **Visual Customization**: Added `tfa.quotaDisplayStyle` setting enabling users to choose between the new Semi-Arc and the Classic Donut styles.
- **Responsive Footer**: Optimized the sidebar footer for narrow panel widths with automatic button wrapping and layout adjustments.

### Improved
- **Type Safety**: Eliminated `any` usage in core webview components for better reliability.
- **Math Precision**: Extracted SVG geometry calculations to a shared utility with dedicated unit tests.

### Fixed
- **Sidebar Layout Overflow**: Resolved an issue where footer buttons would be cut off in extremely narrow sidebar states.

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added
- **Intelligent Feedback System**: Added a localization-aware bug reporting system with automatic diagnostic pre-filling (version, OS, error codes).
- **Advanced Diagnostics**: `ProcessFinder` now identifies specific failure reasons: `no_process`, `ambiguous` (multi-instance), `no_port`, and `auth_failed`.
- **Parsing Error Monitoring**: Added monitoring for server API response anomalies with dedicated feedback triggers.
- **Localization Framework**: Implemented `vscode.l10n` for runtime notifications, ensuring 100% i18n alignment for error messages.
- **Model Quota Granularity**: Separated Gemini 3 Flash and Pro into distinct tracking groups in the status bar and sidebar.
- **Community Integration**: Added a prominent "Join Discussions" button in the sidebar footer to bridge user feedback and GitHub discussions.
- **Quality Guard**: Integrated Husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality with automated ESLint checks and unit tests before every commit.
- **Streamlined Status Bar**: Active group quota is now displayed with concise labels (Pro/Flash) and an enhanced hover tooltip showing all active groups' details.

### Changed
- **UI Realignment**: Fixed redundant naming in sidebar titles; now standardized as `Antigravity: Toolkit`.
- **Architecture Refinement**: Extracted feedback logic into a reusable `FeedbackManager` component, maintaining MVVM cleanliness.
- **Dashboard Sorting**: Quota disks now strictly follow the order defined in `quota_strategy.json`, ensuring Gemini Flash always appears first.

### Fixed
- **UI Sync Deadzone**: Resolved an issue where quota disks would display 0% instead of 100% when the reset timer hit "Ready".
- **ESLint Technical Debt**: Cleaned up all 11+ identified linting errors and warnings for a cleaner codebase.


## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-17

> **The Architecture Update**: A complete recreation of the internal engine based on MVVM architecture, ensuring stability, testability, and future extensibility.

### Improved
