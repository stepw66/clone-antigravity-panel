## Entities

### AntigravityPanel

- **Type**: `PROJECT`
- **Observations**:
  - A VS Code extension toolkit for Antigravity IDE users, providing quota monitoring, cache management, and system visualization.
  - Current version is 2.4.2.
  - Includes 'Auto-Accept' (Hands-free Mode) feature for automatically approving agent steps and terminal commands.

### Brain Directory

- **Type**: `STORAGE_PATH`
- **Observations**:
  - Contains sub-folders for each Task, each typically including a task.md file.
  - Maps directly to the physical path ~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/.
  - Primary target for space/cache management within the Antigravity toolkit.

### Cache Management

- **Type**: `FUNCTIONALITY`
- **Observations**:
  - Focuses on managing the ~/.gemini/antigravity/brain/ directory.
  - Includes automated cleaning of old tasks based on size or count.
  - Synchronizes deletions in brain/ with corresponding files in conversations/ directory.

### LocalizationStrategy

- **Type**: `STRATEGY`
- **Observations**:
  - All hover tooltips, settings descriptions, and system notifications must be fully localized in all 13 supported languages to provide clear functional explanations.
  - All user-facing technical UI labels and command titles (e.g., 'Restart Service', 'Rules', 'MCP', 'Auto-Accept') must remain in English across all supported locales to maintain technical consistency.
  - The project supports 13 languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Korean, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, and Turkish.
  - This strategy is documented in 'docs/LOCALIZATION_RULES.md'.

### Projects Directory (Code Contexts)

- **Type**: `STORAGE_PATH`
- **Observations**:
  - Deleting items here triggers a re-index of the project the next time the Agent enters it.
  - Managed via getCodeContexts() and deleteContext() methods in CacheService.
  - Maps to physical path ~/.gemini/antigravity/code_tracker/active/.
  - Represented as the 'Code Tracker' section in the sidebar UI.
  - Stores active code context indices, project snapshots, and tracking data generated by Antigravity's Code Tracker.
